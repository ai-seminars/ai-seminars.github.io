<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Frontier Development Lab (FDL) is a year-long accelerated research program centred on an 8-week intensive research sprint. The program brings together interdisciplinary teams to solve carefully chosen challenges by applying artificial intelligence to remote sensing data. FDL has been running since 2015 in partnership with leading public and private organisations that include: NASA, ESA, The SETI Institute, Oxford University, Google, NVIDIA and Lockheed Martin. Outcomes are high-impact and open-source - anybody can build on the results. In this presentation I will showcase some of FDLâ€™s recent successes, including the first FDL-affiliated program in Australia on bushfires. I will also talk about my personal journey from academia to industry, and share some insight on better engagement between the two worlds.</p>

<p>Cormac is a 18-year veteran of the academic world, recently making the transition to industry. He was a lecturer at Macquarie University specialising in radio astronomy and the interstellar medium. After some adventures in interdisciplinary science, he is now program director at Trillium Technologies Australia, working on a diverse projects involving bushfires, sharks and machine learning.</p>

<h3 id="abstract-1">Abstract</h3>
<p>Over the past decade, the landmark of telco industry has changed from providing basic phone and internet services to seamless connectivity through technology and services like 5G and Internet of Things. As a result, the use of Artificial Intelligence in the industry has been amplified, especially heightened in the last year. This talk will cover how Artificial Intelligence is empowering and revolutionising the way Telcos operate and provide services to customers, the implementation challenges we face and how to best use Artificial Intelligence to drive business outcomes.</p>
<h3 id="bio-1">Bio</h3>
<p>Upon completing her PhD in engineering from UNSW, she worked across banking, media and telco industries before joining Telstra 2 years ago. She is currently an Advanced Analytics Chapter Lead at Telstra, leading a team of insights analysts and data scientists, supporting Consumer and Small Business functions within Telstra from data and analytics perspective. Fei is passionate about technology, data, analytics, AI and machine learning, especially building and lifting enterprise capabilities in those areas. On top of her day to day job, she is helping to foster data science community in Telstra through Telstra Helix and Data 4 Good, focusing on using data science skills to drive social outcomes for charities.</p>
