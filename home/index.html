<h2 id="who-are-you-new-approaches-for-authentication-in-smart-spaces">Who Are You? New Approaches for Authentication in Smart Spaces</h2>
<p>Teams meeting TBA</p>
<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>Smart environments are increasingly offering a range of personalised services which require knowing the identity of the person currently using the space. Widely used authentication methods including fingerprint and face recognition have been shown to be vulnerable. In the first part of this talk, we present a human identification mechanism called Vein‐ID, that uses the vein pattern of an individual&rsquo;s hand dorsum recorded using an off‐the‐shelf depth camera. Vein-ID extracts vein patterns using the depth information and infrared images. Two deep learning models are presented for precisely identifying a target individual from a set of enrolled users. We demonstrate using a comprehensive data set of approximately 17,500 images from 35 subjects that Vein-ID can identify an individual with an average accuracy of over 99%. In the second part of this talk, we show that WiFi signals can be used to uniquely identify people. There is strong evidence that suggests that all humans have a unique gait. An individual’s gait will thus create unique perturbations in the WiFi spectrum. We propose a system called Gate-ID that analyses the channel state information from ambient WiFi signals to extract unique features that are representative of that individual&rsquo;s gait. Gate-ID uses a novel attention-based deep learning model that fuses various weighted features and ignores ineffective noise to uniquely identify individuals. We implement Gate-ID on commercial off-the-shelf devices and demonstrate that it can uniquely identify individuals with average accuracy of 90.7% to 75.7% from a group of 6 to 20 people, respectively. Both systems are resilient to attacks. Unlike other physical biometric identifiers, surreptitiously capturing an individuals&rsquo;s vein pattern is difficult. Furthermore, mimicking an individual&rsquo;s walking style is equally hard.</p>

<h2 id="artificial-intelligence-in-telco-industry-what-how-and-why">Artificial Intelligence in Telco industry: What, how and why?</h2>
<p><a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3acbc898078cf7462b93ad7fbf79ff98db%40thread.tacv2/1616647296440?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%223ff6cfa4-e715-48db-b8e1-0867b9f9fba3%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%228040ef85-4a89-4cad-a2c5-2f5422d21d3e%22%7d">Join Teams Meeting</a></p>
<h3 id="abstract-1">Abstract</h3>
<p>Over the past decade, the landmark of telco industry has changed from providing basic phone and internet services to seamless connectivity through technology and services like 5G and Internet of Things. As a result, the use of Artificial Intelligence in the industry has been amplified, especially heightened in the last year. This talk will cover how Artificial Intelligence is empowering and revolutionising the way Telcos operate and provide services to customers, the implementation challenges we face and how to best use Artificial Intelligence to drive business outcomes.</p>
<h3 id="bio-1">Bio</h3>
<p>Upon completing her PhD in engineering from UNSW, she worked across banking, media and telco industries before joining Telstra 2 years ago. She is currently an Advanced Analytics Chapter Lead at Telstra, leading a team of insights analysts and data scientists, supporting Consumer and Small Business functions within Telstra from data and analytics perspective. Fei is passionate about technology, data, analytics, AI and machine learning, especially building and lifting enterprise capabilities in those areas. On top of her day to day job, she is helping to foster data science community in Telstra through Telstra Helix and Data 4 Good, focusing on using data science skills to drive social outcomes for charities.</p>
