<h3 id="abstract">Abstract:</h3>
<p>Botnets are a major concern for IoT devices deployed on a large scale. Botnets not only can discover new vulnerable devices but are also proficient in injecting malware into the target devices. The estimated traffic generated by such botnets is of the order of Tbps and the attacks cost billions of dollars to the global economy every year.</p>
<p>This talk highlights the problem of detecting botnet attacks on IoT devices and presents a novel, complete botnet detection framework that makes use of concepts in the immune system. The proposed framework consists of “intelligent” agents that can “learn” new patterns with minimal or no supervision. It provides innate and adaptive detection on principles similar to the human immune response and performs botnet detection at different levels known as lines of defence. Each line of defence is composed of one or more detection agents that are composed of different types of artificial neural networks. The innate detection mechanism is responsible to detect botnets that are not known yet and provides a general detection and works on the principles of the biological cell division process. The adaptive detection mechanism makes use of accurate and low-latency neural networks that are trained for specific behaviours. The core of adaptive detection is composed of a novel system inspired by Hematopoietic Stem cells.</p>

<p>Dr Kashif Naveed has just completed his PhD from the School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). Two of his papers received the best paper awards in highly ranked IEEE conferences LCN 2020 and ICCD 2017. His research interests mainly include cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, specifically on how to make IoT devices secure using ML and AI. In addition, Kashif has extensive experience in developing Wireless Communication, Material Handling, Rail, Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine to Machine (M2M) Communication Systems. He is currently working as a senior engineer at Prezzee.</p>
