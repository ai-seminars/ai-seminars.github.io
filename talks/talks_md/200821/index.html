<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>Maintaining metadata records for scientific imaging is challenging where the link between the metadata and the image can be broken. We propose a method for using QR codes in images to embed the metadata, so that it can be extracted on demand. By using a novel pipeline for generating QR codes, displaying them in images, reading the QR codes in the images and extracting the metadata for later action such as renaming the image file, a streamlined process for metadata management is introduced. This method was simulated using a range of image types and QR code parameters to identify the limits of various parameter combinations, providing practical insight into code design and usability. The pipeline was also tested with hundreds of images in both laboratory and field situations and proved to be extremely efficient and robust. This method offers potential for anyone taking images of samples who needs to guarantee the existence and correctness of metadata without relying on an external association mechanism.</p>
