<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>There are many situations in deep learning where we wish to force a set of vectors or activations to approximate either a hyperspherical or multivariate Gaussian distribution. For example, deep autoencoders aim to map a set of real images or other data to latent variables, enabling the reconstruction of the original images as well as generation of similar images from random latent variables.</p>
<p>In this talk, we show how this type of regularization can be achieved using a novel loss function inspired by Thomson&rsquo;s Plum Pudding model of the atom, which simulates a repulsive force between every pair of items, and an attractive force of each item toward the origin. We discuss how this loss function can be applied to Autoencoders and Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks, and how it may potentially provide a foundation for deep principal component analysis</p>
