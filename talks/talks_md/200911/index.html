<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>As Computers behave more like humans, how will they impact real people?</p>
<p>Skilling up for AI -powered future requires more than science, technology, engineering, and math. As computers behave more like humans, the social sciences and humanities will become more important.</p>
<p>The development and deployment of AI must be guided by the creation of an ethical framework. There are six core principles that should guide the work around AI. Four core principles of fairness, reliability &amp; safety, privacy &amp; security, and inclusiveness, underpinned by two foundational principles of transparency and accountability. These six principles are necessary but not sufficient and they do not answer every question.</p>
<p>One big question that we have been pondering is whether we might see a Hippocratic oath for coders, similar to the Hippocratic oath that doctors take that says that first they will ‘do no harm’. – The Future Computed</p>
<p>Ultimately, this discussion around ethics and codes of practice looks at how we as a society can stay true to timeless values in developing and delivering this new technology. Angela will discuss about how to promote human centered, transparent and ethical AI by design.</p>
