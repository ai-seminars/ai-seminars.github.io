<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>Fair division is an important problem facing society today as increasing economical, environmental, and other pressures require us to try to do more with limited resources. In this talk, I survey some recent work in the ADT group at CSE studying fair division problems derived from real world applications. In each case, this threw up some interesting theoretical problems not previously studied in the literature.</p>
